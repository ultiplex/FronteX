Proof of concept for decentralized interfaces as composable, mintable, non-transferable ERC721 representing IPFS hash. 

Despite the consensual and rich data sets dapps are still built as siloses, not really utilizing provided interoperability. We are proposing distributing the functionality with native monetization model for developers. 

This PoC is inspired by the early human societies. We argue that imitation was a driving force of the evolution. The first signs of obvious imitation are the stone tools made by Homo habilis 2.5 million years ago. As the new skills begin to spread it becomes more and more important to be able to acquire them. And how do you acquire them? â€“ by imitation of course. Thus, being a good imitator became increasingly important.

We believe that NFTs understood as crypto avatars are currently on the very same stage, however here the skills will be needed to survive in the attention economy and the skills themselves will be used as access tokens to particular functionality that extends the value of the avatar.

Adding a medium (HTML/JS, image, video, anything) results in creating corresponding IPFS hash that's translated into ERC721 that's owned by an avatar. This token can be minted in the process of learning, however it can't be traded as it becomes a part of a personality. Learning a new skill expands memepool, the same way learning English allowed me to learn about Ethereum. It can occur for free or for particular amount of ERC20/ERC721 tokens defined by a linear or a bonded curve.
